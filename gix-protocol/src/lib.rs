//! An abstraction over [fetching][fetch()] a pack from the server and [pushing][push()] to it.
//!
//! Generally, there is the following order of operations.
//!
//! * create a `Transport`, either blocking or async
//! * perform a [`handshake()`]
//! * execute a [`Command`]
//!     - [list references](LsRefsCommand)
//!          - create a mapping between [refspecs and references](fetch::RefMap)
//!     - [receive a pack](fetch()) or [send a pack](push())
//!
